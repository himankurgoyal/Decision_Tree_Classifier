# Decision_Tree_Classifier
Task 3: Exploring Decision Tree Algorithm

1) From the given iris Dataset, I  have created the Decision Tree Classifier and Visualize it graphically. 
2) Starting from importing the libraries followed by Data Exploration and Data Visualization. 
3) The very next step is to do a little of feature engineering. 
4) The target column is of Object type(categorical values), so i just converted them to integer type using apply function on the column "Species". 
5) After feature engineering , I have started building Decision-tree Classifier on Train-dataset, keeping all parameters as defualt,try to fit this model.
6) After fitting, I did model testing on the unseen data followed by comparion predicted values with the actual values. 
7) At last i did some evaluation which results in extreme good accuracy followed by visualization of a decision tree. 
8) This model was well trained efficiently and is able to predict the right values when feed with further unseen new Dataset.
